# Swirlds Base Sample

## Goal

A simple enough application that utilizes platform-base modules. This application serves as a testing environment for platform-base module behavior without the need for platform and services layers.

## Overview

This project consists of a simple inventory management application that provides a REST API to handle items, inventories, and operations. The application utilizes an Undertow HTTP server to listen to connections on the configured port and limited 3erd party dependencies.

### Dependencies

The project makes use of the following modules:

- **swirlds-config**: Module for configuration management.
- **swirlds-metrics**: Module for reporting metrics.
- **swirlds-logging**: TODO: pending

The project makes use of the following 3erd party dependencies:
- **Undertow**: embedded application server.
- **jackson**: json serializing/deserializing.
- **guava**: parameters validation + immutable collections.
- **spot-bugs**: non-null checks.
- **log4j2**: to-be-replaced in the future for swirlds-logging.

Also requires the following tools
- **docker-compose**

### Features being showcased & under test

- **Logging**: Provides logging functionality to track application behavior and errors. Currently implemented using log4j
- **Metrics Reporting**: Offers metrics reporting capabilities to monitor application performance.
- **Configuration**: Supports configuration management for easy customization.

### Prometheus Integration

The application declares predefined metrics to consume in the Prometheus endpoint. By default, the application starts on port 8000, and metrics are exposed on port 8001.

## Docker Compose

The project provides a Docker Compose file that enables the following services:

- **Swagger UI**: A user-friendly interface for interacting with the REST API. Accessible on port 8080.
- **Prometheus Server**: Consumes metrics generated by the application.
- **Grafana**: Provides visualization capabilities with a custom dashboard included.

## Usage

To run the application is through docker-compose & intelliJ:
1. Build the application using `gradlew assemble`.
2. Build the application using `gradlew run` or hit play in [BaseSampleMain.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fswirlds%2Fbase%2Fsample%2FBaseSampleMain.java) main method.
3. inside `./docker` folder run `docker-compose up`
4. Access the Swagger UI for interacting with the REST API. The Swagger UI runs on `http://localhost:8080/`.
5. Monitor metrics using the Prometheus server running on `http://localhost:9090/`.
6. Access application's scrap endpoint for prometheus at port `http://localhost:9999/`.
7. Visualize metrics using Grafana on `http://localhost:3000/`.

 There is a dashboard automatically included under explore.
 First time logging will require to change admin password.
8. Example Http requests have been included in [http-requests](http-requests%2FItems.http).
9. Rest api will be running on port 8000.


## To Be Included

1. change log4j to swirlds-logging
2. add loki and elasticsearch for logging
